# GoDaddy Website Hosting and File Upload Guide

## Check if You Have Hosting

1. First, you need to make sure you have purchased hosting along with your domain. A domain is just the web address (like zphsgudikandula.com), but you also need hosting space to store your website files.

2. Log in to your GoDaddy account at https://www.godaddy.com/

3. After logging in, look for "My Products" or "Web Hosting" in your dashboard.

4. If you don't see hosting listed, you'll need to purchase it. Click on "Web Hosting" and select a plan that suits your needs (the Basic plan should be sufficient for your school website).

## Accessing File Manager and Uploading Files

If you already have hosting with GoDaddy, follow these steps to upload your website files:

1. Log in to your GoDaddy account

2. Go to "My Products" and find your hosting plan

3. Click on "Manage" next to your hosting plan

4. This will take you to the hosting control panel. Look for "File Manager" or "cPanel" (depending on your hosting type)

5. If you see cPanel, click on it and then find the "File Manager" icon

6. In File Manager, navigate to the "public_html" or "www" folder - this is where your website files should go

7. Click the "Upload" button at the top of the page

8. Select all your website files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) and upload them

9. Create a folder called "Images" and upload all your image and video files to this folder

## Alternative: Using FTP to Upload Files

If you prefer using FTP (File Transfer Protocol), which can be easier for uploading multiple files:

1. From your GoDaddy hosting dashboard, look for "FTP Information" or "FTP Accounts"

2. Create an FTP account or note down your existing FTP credentials (hostname, username, password)

3. Download and install an FTP client like FileZilla (free) from https://filezilla-project.org/

4. Open FileZilla and enter your FTP credentials to connect to your hosting

5. Navigate to the "public_html" or "www" folder on the right side (remote server)

6. On the left side (your computer), navigate to where your website files are stored

7. Select all your website files and drag them to the right side to upload

## Testing Your Website

After uploading all files:

1. Visit your domain name in a web browser (e.g., yourdomain.com)

2. If you see a "Coming Soon" page or GoDaddy placeholder, you may need to wait a few hours for DNS propagation, or check if there's a setting in your hosting dashboard to make your site live

## Getting Help from GoDaddy

If you're still having trouble:

1. GoDaddy has 24/7 customer support. Call their support line or use their live chat.

2. Ask specifically about "how to upload website files to my hosting account"

3. They can guide you through the process or even help you set up your website remotely
